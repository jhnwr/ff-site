# Kriega US-30 Drypack Review


## Kriega US-30 Drypack Review

I’ve been thinking a lot about sorting out some more trips for this year. I didn’t manage to get out and about as much as I’d have liked to last year, so I want to get something organised soon. I’d really like to do a solo camping trip and I’ve started thinking about what I’d need to take. This got me thinking about how much stuff I can fit in my US30. 

You can find the US30 on [Amazon here.](https://amzn.to/2SUQHT4)

I bought it last year at the beginning of summer as I wanted a new luggage option for longer trips and seeing as I’ve had a [US10](https://amzn.to/2SUQHT4) for over 10 years now and still going strong it seemed like the logical choice. I was torn though, as it is more expensive than some other options, but I’d be happy to say now that it was very worth it.

### How much can you fit in a Kriega US30?

That depends! From my experience and talking to friends who have them, and the smaller US20, is that generally the US30 is good for at least a week away. But of course, this will vary on what, and how you pack, and how you rate certain items on your priority list.

Excluding tools (under my seat) and bike gear I would be wearing, this is my rough list of items for a 5 day trip, staying in hotels/B&Bs

* Lightweight trainers
* 6 pairs of socks
* 6 pairs underwear (spare just in case..)
* Shorts
* Jeans/trousers
* 5 t shirts
* 2 Jumpers
* Sleeping shorts
* Laptop/iPad
* Charger
* GoPro bits
* Headphones
* Washbag
* Microfibre towel – I have one of [these](https://amzn.to/317AP2A) it’s awesome

This I could easily fit in the US30 with room to spare. From there I would fill in the gaps with anything else I might need, more clothes, spare gloves or base layers etc, none of which take up much room. I will caveat this however, I’m assuming I’m eating/drinking out each night or buying from a shop and staying UK only. Going abroad isn’t a whole lot different but you’ll need extra precautionary items. At home if anything goes wrong I have breakdown cover and a credit card.

If we go back a few years, to my first trip to Europe – we did 5 days and 4 EU countries albeit in a very laid-back affair, there was lots of us so there was a bit of socialising and sightseeing. I totaled around 1100 miles all in and had 2 full side panniers and a full large topbox. I honestly can’t remember what I had with me, but it was a lot! I didn’t use much of it either. It made me think about what I was taking.

It is very easy to pack clothes into once you learn how to roll them up nice and tight and pack them in top loaded to fill every little space. The problem is fitting footwear as bulky items like that take up a lot of space for what they are. I have found that packing my trainers in width ways in a plastic bag, heal to do works best – even more so if you have lightweight pumps or similar. Another good tip is a microfibre towel, packs up super small and fits in nicely.

### Is it worth the extra over the US20?

It’s 50% more space with the same fitting and construction and in my opinion, it is worth it. I see the US20 as more of a couple of day pack, even if the most minimalist packers could get much longer out of it. I was worried that the US30 would be too big but even when completely full I’ve not had a problem with it feeling too large or have it obstructing my riding.

All of the Kriega US packs can be combined together via the mounting system on each bag. I do have a US10 but have never found the need to use it at the same time as the US30. You could if you wanted to mount 2x US20’s to a US30 to give massive space.

### How does the US30 it fit to your bike?

Included with the bag are 4 straps with a reinforced loop at one end. These fit around the subframe under the rear seat. Remove the seat and thread the strap around the metal and fix down. The small loop will protrude from under the rear seat and prove the hooking point for the metal strap ends. It’s very easy to do and does not get in the way at all.

The only down side is having to take the straps with you when you take the bag off – be careful not to lose them, I ted to put mine in the front pouch. ![Kriega US30 - straps](/images/kriegaus30-8.jpg)

### Does it matter if my US30 isn’t full?

No! The straps are meant to be tightened down over the bag to secure it. However if its completely empty the straps wont quite be enough to hold it tight. It wont fall off but just won’t fit as well. I’ve toyed with getting a plastic crate to fit inside for the days when I need some stuff but not much, as I don’t like riding with a backpack.

The US30 will easily fit a laptop, clothes and lunch for commuting but as I tend to commute light and leave everything I need at work already I would use the US10 as my sandwich carrier.

### Is the US30 usable off the bike?

It comes with a shoulder strap, and a waist strap and to be honest it’s quite comfortable to carry around on your back should you get off and wander around. However, it is more of a faff than just locking your topbox but it is a different type of luggage system.

The US30 is best at home for carrying all the stuff you need for a week away on the bike. Pack it up in the morning and forget it’s there, enjoy the ride and scenery and when you get to your next over night stop your belongings will be right there nice and dry.

### How is it better than a normal rollbag/drybag?

The fitting system. It’s far superior than bungees and roll bag. Don’t get me wrong that would work for some, but for an extra bit of initial cost you will get a bag designed for the back of a sportsbike, that fasten downs properly, is made of quality materials and is fully waterproof.

Under the bag is a rubber mesh, partly to stop it sliding on the seat but it doubles up as a useful towel holder, stopping you having to put a wet towel back into the bag (you do shower right), or perhaps separating dirty laundry from the clean. All in this is a top notch bag that I would highly recommend (along with countless others) for anyone wanting to do some trips away.
