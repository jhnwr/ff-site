# The Quest for Power: Is more BHP always better?


It’s an interesting paradigm when talking about power figures, and what they actually mean to the vast majority of us. The fact that power is a comparable measure of a bikes performance leads to lots of debate and potentially discarding bikes as they have slightly less power than the competitor. If we take the earliest Fireblades, which had around 111 hp, and compare to now the 2019 model is pushing 171hp – this begs the question, have we gone too far?

There is of course so much more to think about than just that, and given the extra electronic aids, stopping power and improved chassis more power is a natural progression, seeing an increase as it becomes easier to transfer to the ground, and in an ultimate situation of racing, or track riding I do get it, honestly I do – but for commuting or spirited road riding when did 100 horses stop being enough? Well, that’s the thing. For me it never did. Nor did 50 hp, or 25..

You can’t ignore the fact that some bikes are definitely under powered but I think there is a lot to be said about lower power machines. In fact so do lots of others, KTM have the 390cc Duke, and RC, Yamaha have an R300 and Kawasaki the Ninja 300 (and 250 prevoiusly) among others. Mostly these are high spec bikes, designed or derived from bigger brothers, and not simply dull commuters in a frock – these are to be ridden and enjoyed. I think there’s a lot of merit in this idea, and it’s not new – think of the old 400cc sports bikes that got phased out in favor of 600’s and you can’t help think keeping some of those models going would be a killer idea now.

But will we miss the power, when it’s gone? That’s the golden question, one that can’t be answered for each individual and one you must find out for yourself. I haven’t made the jump.. not yet. I am sorely tempted but the thrill of guiding 100+ hp down the road is still too great. Licenses can be lost on any bike, and unfortunately so can life. The main appeal is being able to push a bike harder, use all of its power, work the engine more, and feel more engaged at a slightly slower speed. This is where the difference between 40hp, 100hp or more can be noticed the most. It’s not that simple though – Kawasaki’s 1990 KR1S came with 53hp, about the same as an early Honda Deauville… 

This in part isn’t surprising at those two bikes were clearly built for different purposes. But what I think I’m trying to say is power doesn’t equal fun and riding experience which is what we are all searching for and spending our time and money on. Take the rise of the Honda MSX (Grom) as a good example of that, a tiny 10hp bike that took the world by storm selling thousands. The newest one costs just over 3 grand too, you can get a lot of second hand bikes for that!

I think it’s clear that for the majority of us its all about the ride and having fun, so pick your poison 171 v 9 and get out and ride.
