# Motorbike Ground Anchors – Reviews, Fitting and Using


**Since I moved to a new house** with a garage, I started looking at sorting out security for my ZX6R. Previously it lived outside under a cover, tucked away in a private gated car park, but now even though it’s behind a garage door I think it’s always worth doing everything you can to deter potential thieves. That’s where a good ground anchor can help.

It’s a relatively inexpensive way to add another level of security making it all that bit harder for someone to take your pride and joy. No matter where you keep your bike – outside or in your garage, anchoring to the floor or wall, there’s an option available to you – and with some now coming with the Sold Secure Gold approval rating, there’s no better time than now to add a ground anchor to your security system!

## What is the Benefit of a Ground Anchor?

Having a disc lock or just a chain only prevents the bike being rolled and while this may stop/deter some chancers the serious thieves will come in a group equipped for stealing bikes, a van and bolt cutters to cut the chain, pick the bike up and take it away. Even the biggest bikes don’t pose too much of a challenge to lift, and our 200kg or less sportsbikes can be picked up easily and loaded into a van with 3-4 people.

Having something to attach to will significantly increases the effort required to move and load the bike and this is where a good ground anchor comes in. Offering Sold Secure ratings and providing a physical object that would need to be broken will make your bike less likely to be taken/targeted.

## Types of Ground Anchor

Not all ground anchors are equal. There are different ways of fixing, numbers of bolts, size and materials to consider when purchasing. Think about where and how you want to mount it.

### Cement In

These are what they say, you need to dig out a hole and concrete the anchor in place. The main advantage of these is they are incredibly hard to pull out of the ground and leave only a metal ring above the ground for anyone to hammer on to try to break. This ring rotates making it easier to mount inaccessibly whilst still being able to get a chain through. Construction material is key here – only accept high quality hardened steel. 

* Concrete in to the ground
* Heavy duty hardened steel
* Can be used indoors as well as out
* Head rotates
* Leave chain available on the ground

### Y Anchors

These are gaining popularity as they sit flush to the concrete leaving nothing showing to be attacked, and no eye sores or toe stubbing hazards. They require the most effort to fit and come Sold Secure Gold rated so are a very valid option for some people. 

* Most effort and tools required to fit
* Require digging a hole and concreting in
* Possibly most secure
* Permanent

### Bolt Down

Possibly the common type due to ease of fitment in a garage or outside a house. Most of these come with 4 bolts and sleeves and fit into drilled holes into the floor. The bolts are then tightened down and the allen heads destroyed by tapping in a small ball bearing. The chain then loops through the gap in the anchor and around the bike. These can be mounted to brick walls as well as floors making them more versatile and are able to keep the chain off the ground. 

* Bolt down
* Mountable to floors or brick walls
* Some are Sold Secure approved
* Easy to fit
* Hardened steel to prevent saws or sledge hammers

Personally as much as I like the idea of a concrete in ground anchor, its just not that practical for me. My bike lives in a garage in a block around the corner of my house and so I opted for a bolted down ground anchor tucked away in the corner. There are lots of these types out there and I believe you get what you pay for. Cheaper ones will have used poorer quality materials and could crumble under a sledge hammer smash or even be cut away with hand tools. As I said at the beginning it’s an extra deterrent, but one well worth having if you can fit it in.

## How to install a ground anchor in your garage

*What you will need:*

* A decent drill, preferably mains powered but I have had some success with cordless (best for walls)
* New masonry drill bit

Select where you are going to position the anchor. Keep it away from the open middle of the garage as this will give potential thieves ample room around to hack and smash away at it. The best places are tucked away at the back corner of the garage, hidden away by the bike if possible.

Keep in mind your chain length, then drill pilot holes using the guide provided, or the actual unit itself. Making sure you have a pilot hole will mean you drill straight and not have the holes in the wrong place. Gently press in the outer bolt sleeves. You may need to use the bolt slightly screwed in and tap it lightly into place.

Once all are in and lined up bolt the anchor down tightly but be careful not to over tighten. This could damage the bolt compromising security. Tap down the ball bearing to destroy the allen bolt head preventing any unscrewing.

Same process if you are fitting to the wall, again tuck it away in the corner at a height where the chain is off the ground. This makes it harder to cut the chain itself as there is less leverage available. Make sure it’s positioned to go through the middle of the brick and not near any mortar which is potentially weaker.
Tips for using and securing your motorbike with a ground anchor

Stay away from cheap unbranded items, and while some maybe good it’s unlikely that a smaller company will have the QC processes and backing behind it to keep making high grade hardened steel ground anchors. I am sure that there are quality versions out there at a lower cost, but I would prefer to stay on the side of the larger companies and always look for the Sold Secure approval before you purchase.

Where possible try to keep the chain off the floor. It’s much easier to break a chain that’s on the ground as it gives a strong leverage point allowing more force to be applied. It’s even harder when the chain is in a corner making access for large bolt cutters tricky. Try to position it in a way where the bike can be a shield for the chain and anchor. It will make your life a little harder but will make a thief’s life much harder too.

Loop the chain through the frame or swingarm of the bike, its not uncommon for thieves to remove a wheel to lift the bike – leaving your chain and anchor untouched.

Buy a good chain! Your security is only as good as its weakest link. Almax and [Oxford](https://amzn.to/2GjVzh2) both make great chains and spend as much as you can.
