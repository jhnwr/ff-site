# Motorbike Camping – Best Tent?


**I am an avid camper and rider** but only recently began mixing the two. Camping for me is historically been large tents and lots of gear – cooking equipment, entertainment; everything I thought I could ever possibly need would get chucked into the back of the estate car and off we went.

However that’s not really viable when you’re on two wheels. Space is a premium so gear must be slimmed down and match the required criteria. It’s important I think here to mention what I was aiming for when I chose the Nevis 200 tent as not everyone will have the same priorities or take the same trips as I do.

I wanted to be able to go off riding for a day and setup for one or two nights away at the most and enjoy a reasonably comfortable night away. For lots the best solution could be a budget hotel, or spend more and stay at a nice pub – and I’ve done that too but given my love for the outdoors and camping I wanted to get a tent.

## My Criteria

I wanted to have something that would serve a few separate purposes and would be good quality enough to last me a few years. I can see myself hiking and having a tent that could fit that would be a benefit.

* Pack Size
* Lightweight
* Waterproof
* Large enough to sit up
* Easy to put up and take down
* Space for a helmet and leathers

Given I have a ZX6R I wanted to make sure I had the smallest pack size I could reasonably find and started to look for something that would fit into my Kriega US30 should I need it to, or at least not be longer than it so it could be mounted together. It needed to be reasonably lightweight so to not be a burden moving it around. A high hydro-static head would keep any unwanted rain out, having woken up in wet tent before this is important. The ability to be able to sit up also made my list as it makes the comfort and quality of life a little better when inside, enabling you to change a little bit easier. Having somewhere to store bike gear and still be able to sleep comfortably was also a must, so this ruled out all 1 man tents.

* Pack Size – 46cm x 15cm. 

This fits perfectly inside a Kriega US30 and also into my 20L Berghaus backpack. It also gave me extra options when thinking about how to pack, and strap everything down to the bike

* Lightweight 2.02 kg

It weights just over 2kg. This seems to be about as low as you can go without spending mega money. It feels durable too.

* Waterproof 3000mm

3000mm on the flysheet and 6000mm on the ground sheet. My main tent is 5000mm and that’s fantastic. I was happy to go with 3000mm though as given the times of year I’d be out this is more than capable.

* Large enough to sit up

Err, yeah, you can. I’m 6ft and had no issues with space either sat up or lying down.

* Easy to put up and take down, 5 mins

I didn’t read the instructions (of course) and it took about 5 minutes to put up. There are 3 poles, 1 main loop and 2 smaller ones to prop up the ends. The inner bedroom comes attached but can be separated and put in after should it be raining when you setup. It comes fully attached out the bag new and I set it up with it clipped in. Pack down is a cinch, remove poles, un-peg and roll up. The bag loads sideways and has straps to squash it all back down to make sure you can get the pack size to what it should be.

* Space for gear

There is a vestibule on one side that I used to store my boots and bag. It’s sheltered but I kept my leathers and helmet inside to make sure they stayed dry. As there is no vestibule on the other side there is enough space to stack your gear away from you so you don’t have to sleep on it.

## What was it like to sleep in?

![Nevis 200 - Sleeping Area](/images/nevis200-inside-1024x768.jpg)

Really good to be honest. There was enough space to stretch out in the night and lie comfortably. I have an old 3 seasons sleeping back and sleeping mat, which were perfectly fine. Ideally I’d have a Thermarest but haven’t bought one yet. I was warm enough and dry enough, plus I was able to roll into it slightly intoxicated – and more importantly, get out easily when the inevitable night wee is needed…
