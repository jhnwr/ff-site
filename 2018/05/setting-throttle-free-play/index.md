# Setting Your Throttle Free Play


It’s important to get the throttle free play correct as it will improve responsiveness and the ability to ride smoothly. The throttle is one of the most important controls your bike has so it’s got to be precise to enable you to ride properly. Generally manufacturers recommend around 2-3mm of travel before the cable pulls. This means that when you fully close the throttle expect it to have this amount of free play before it engages – too much and you wont be able to ride smoothly.

This is important because if it is too tight the bike may rev when on full lock. Set none at all and you might even end up with a runaway machine!

Expect the cable to stretch out slightly with use, so this is a good thing to check when buying an older bike. Adjusting is easy to do, at both the grip end and the throttle body/carbs. Once you have you free play within tolerance do a quick check – with the bike running move the bars from side to side full lock and see if you can hear any change in revs. Assuming not your all good to get going.

* 2 – 3 mm of free play
* Adjust at grip and carbs if necessary
* Check once done for safety
