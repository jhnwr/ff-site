# How to load your Sportbike - Best Luggage Options


*And why tail packs are my go to..*

lot of people's first point of call for touring or long trips away would be a big, upright touring bike with hard panniers and a large top box. With lots of space for stowing away items that you may (or may not) need whilst your away. This is a fair point, but unless you are doing serious miles and several weeks away is this really necessary? To do a weekend away in France, Germany or Belgium do we really need to sell our sportbikes and all buy BMW GS1200s with all the super expensive luggage? No, of course not. With some clever packing and being realistic with what you need you can fit everything in and enjoy some of the best biking roads around on a bike that suits them down to the ground.

### So what’s the best way of carrying your stuff on your sportbike?

There are a few options around that have various benefits and draw backs that I will outline here hopefully to help those of your who aren’t so sure what sportbike luggage system best suits your needs.

## Load the Bike, not the Rider

It can be very tempting to just pack everything you need into your backpack and go, and while this is done and can work, generally it’s best avoided. Riding distance with a heavy backpack gets tiring quite quickly and can put your off your riding from extra fatigue. It’s also harder to centralise the load properly on yourself and can be uncomfortable. For short distances or light loads sure, no worries it make sense, but once you hit some twisties you’ll be thankful for not having a backpack on. There are some really good backpacks out there though, so if you invest it could still be a decent option for you, or as a last resort when your other bags on the bike are full, and you just have to carry a bit more!

#### Pros

* Quick and easy solution
* Great off the bike

#### Cons

* Tiring to ride long distances with
* Can be uncomfortable
* Best backpacks are expensive

**Best for: An Addition or very short trip**

## At the front – Tank Bags

A very simple and easy way to carry some things in an easy to remove and get to fashion. A small tank bag is incredibly useful for carrying things you need quick access to, like passport, travel documents and money. I tend to use a small one for those things and some food/water whenever I go away. I’d recommend staying away from larger ones especially for sportbikes as it will get in the way of your riding and vision. You won’t be able to get down behind the screen and could impair your arm movement too.

The are mostly magnetic with a strap round the headstock of the bike and are very secure. I’ve never seen anyone lose one on the motorway, as long as you remember to put it back on after filling up!

#### Pros

* Convenient
* Good for small loads and important docs
* Opt for a small one on a sportbike

#### Cons

* Can get in the way seeing clocks/moving
* May make your riding position uncomfortable

**Best for: commuting or short trips**

## At the back – Tail Packs

This is my preferred method of loading up my bike, mainly because its so versatile and has many options available. Using straps and clips, soft waterproof tail packs attach to your rear pillion seat and come in various sizes and configurations. They are incredibly secure on the move and don’t get in your way. I use a 10L tail pack daily for my lunch and work clothes. I prefer it to backpack and when I take the scenic route home I find it a better option than a tank bag, or backpack, for the reasons stated above. It clips on and off in seconds and is fully waterproof with enough space and a pocket for smaller items. Larger versions also come with a carrying strap for off the bike that tucks underneath and out the way when not needed. You can also strap them together to create more space for longer trips.

#### Pros

* Versatile and configurable
* Easy to attach and remove
* Won’t get in your way while riding
* No dead space when packed.
* Good off the bike

#### Cons

* Not as easy to quickly remove specific items
* Less pockets usually

## Hard Luggage

Generally, not found on sportbikes you can get properly luggage racks for some bikes and there are bespoke rack mounting systems out there that allow you to fit a hard top box to your bike. Hard top boxes are lockable and generally have more space for you to carry your belongings. However, these are designed for Adv bikes or sports tourers, and doesn’t really fit our requirements as sportbike riders – we want to carry our stuff but also be able to slim it back down to do track days, or fast road rides.

#### Pros

* Space
* Lockable
* Expensive

### Cons

* Not designed for sportbikes
* Not easily removed

## Panniers

I generally don’t recommend panniers for sportsbikes as the main ones available for us are throw over soft ones and they just never sit well. There are some good ones available but for me it’s the worst option and the one I have the least experience in.

## Roll Bags

Roll bags or Dry bags, are very common throughout the sports world with campers, sailors, fisherman etc all having use for one. We can also make use of them and it can be a very inexpensive way of getting out gear attached and protected from the elements. Stay small and don't go over the top on size and you should have no problems. I’d recommend around 15-20L, bungee'd to your pillion seat. But as they are universal packs there is no proper mounting system or bespoke clips so it will take more time and effort to make sure they are safe and secure.

#### Pros

* Inexpensive but good quality
* Readily available in a wide range of sizes

#### Cons

* No bike specific mounting
* Hard to get something specific out
* Large ones not designed for bikes won’t fit well.

**Best for: One off luggage on the cheap**


## Conclusion

It isn’t always a clear cut do this, or do that. The main ways of carrying your stuff outlined above each have their own benefits as well as drawbacks, so it’s about what fits your needs best, or what your trip demands. The insight provided should help you decide on which way is best – and that can be all of them! I’ve packed light and carried only bare essentials (referred to as the “one piece and a credit card” method), I’ve packed up a tailpack and slung my backpack on for a weekend away with a hotel base, and also filled up 2 hard panniers and a top box for a 5-day touring trip, albeit not my sportbike. 

I still didn’t need to carry that much though but it was one of my first, and I didn’t want to not have something I needed. With experience you find out what you need. Generally, my favorite luggage system is tail packs and travel light, with a small tank bag for my phone wallet and passport.
