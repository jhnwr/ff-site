            </div><div class="post-content"><p>Owning a budget sports bike can be an incredibly rewarding experience and I recommend everyone who enjoys riding delve into sports bikes at least once in their lives. These days you can get a lot of bike for your cash and picking the right one can often be very difficult. Whether it’s your first time buying a budget sports bike or if you’re getting your second or more this list below may help you when purchasing. These things are often over looked by new potential owners and are worth considering when looking.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="brakes--stopping-power-is-more-important-than-bhp"></a><h2>Brakes – stopping power is more important than BHP</h2>
<p>Braking has come a long way in the past 15-20 years so when considering a certain model always do your research and see how owners rate the OEM brakes. A lot of braking systems may have been sufficient 15 years ago but by today’s standard they may not be up to the task. Consider my ZX6R J1 – it has the Tokico 6 pot front callipers on still, that get a bashing from rider’s with many upgrading to Nissin 4 pots for much improved braking. Always research what callipers and pads are recommended for the bike and check what it currently has on it and potentially factor in an upgrade.</p>
<p>Even if the stock system is a good one, after all these years it’s likely to need a refresh. If your handy yourself calliper seal kits are relatively inexpensive but it’s a reasonable job so factor in around £150 for your local mechanic to do it for you.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="bad-suspension-will-ruin-your-fun"></a><h2>Bad suspension will ruin your fun</h2>
<p>What do people with lower power bikes always tell you? “I’d do you in the twisties!” Probably true, and even more so if your trying to make good progress on the road with tired and worn out forks and shock. It’s the same issue as the brakes, the technology is old now and things like buying a new rear shock and getting the forks serviced comes low down on general joe bloggs maintenance lists. In fact, I’d bet a lot of owners wouldn’t even notice that something wasn’t quite right, with only perhaps an MOT fail nudging them into some much-needed fixing. A fork rebuild and new rear suspension isn’t cheap, so it’s worth thinking about how the bike feels on the test ride before proceeding.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="lack-of-riding-aids"></a><h2>Lack of riding aids</h2>
<p>See how so many new sports bikes have all the fancy rider aids like, ABS, anti-wheelie, launch control and lots of others? Yeah there was none of that 15 years ago. Be prepared to live without. It might suit some people but for lots these little extra things would be useful to have. Cars have had ABS for a long time but it wasn’t common on bikes until recently. It means a much rawer experience for you, but also a lot less forgiving.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="lower-fuel-economy-and-shorter-range"></a><h2>Lower fuel economy and shorter range</h2>
<p>I get about 140 ish miles to a tank. Not great but enough. It can get a bit tense sometimes when riding with a group but to be honest someone is guaranteed to be on an old TL1000 or even an old Hornet, famed for doing 80-90 miles per tank. Everyone fills up at the same time as the guy with the least range.</p>
<p>This only really becomes an issue when you ride every day as filling up a couple of times a week can become extremely tedious. But it’s a small price to pay. Which leads me on to MPG. Expect 40 ish MPG and lowering to 30’s when working hard. My car does 45 all day but is dull as dishwater. Verdict: Don’t think about it just ride.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="no-fuel-gauge-or-digital-instruments"></a><h2>No fuel gauge or digital instruments</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, one more thing on that point, be prepared to work with no fuel gauge. Or worse, a dodgy one. Some stay high up until your final 20 miles and crashing down helplessly giving you barely enough warning. Fortunately, we all have trip meters, so reset it each fill up and fill up around a certain mileage. I tend to go for around 120 miles before getting my wallet out, doing my best to not rely on the reserve.</p>
<p>Newer bikes have nice flashy instrument panels with lots of data, including a digital speedo, which are pretty and can be quite useful. You won’t have that, and will have to make do with what you have. Don’t get me wrong, I much prefer a proper rev counter but a digital speedo would be helpful for those 30 mph zones. I also find that my riding position at lower speeds generally means I can’t see the instrument panel at all.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="carbs-and-their-issues"></a><h2>Carbs (and their issues)</h2>
<p>Most likely you will be looking at a carb’d bike as fuel injection was much less common until the early to mid 2000’s. This isn’t an issue but be aware of a few specific carb issues that FI bike don’t have.</p>
<p>Fuel ratio needs to be adjusted manually, often using aftermarket needles. This means dismantling the carb and fitting a new fuel needle of a different size often call “rejetting”. The most common reason for this is when fitting an aftermarket exhaust. Generally a slip on should be ok without a reject, but a full system is going to need proper tuning and to do this you need the help of an expert and a dyno, otherwise your shiny new exhaust system could ruin the way your bike rides and potentially even damage it by running too lean.</p>
<p>Carbs need looking after. Every service its worth getting them out and cleaning them properly to make sure everything is running as it should be. Same applies to getting them setup properly even on a standard bike.</p>
<a class="post-dummy-target" id="the-necessity-to-learn-to-fix-things-yourself"></a><h2>The necessity to learn to fix things yourself</h2>
<p>As with all older mechanical things there will be a massive wealth of knowledge available on the internet to help you out with any issues you (will) have. So be prepared to get dirty and try to fix the basic things yourself. My last bike was a mid 90’s Honda so I quickly learnt all about charging systems and how to diagnose and fix them. It’s incredibly useful to have the skill to look something up and have a go at fixing it. Somethings of course should be left to the pro’s but doing the basic stuff yourself will save you a lot of aggro and cash throughout your ownership.</p>
<p>I’d recommend always finding out common problems with each make and model your considering buying and writing them down and taking them with you to ask the seller about them. It’s a good test to find out if they know about them, or have fixed them already.</p>
<p>So, there you have it, some commonly neglected things about buying a budget sports bike to consider.</p>
