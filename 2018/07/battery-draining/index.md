# Why Does My Motorcycle Battery Keep Draining?


**Today** I’m going to go through a few points and tips as to help explain what might be causing your battery to go flat and how to prolong the life of your battery and bike electrical system. I have first hand experience having previously owned a mid-90s Honda VFR750 which had charging problems, even causing me to (almost) get stuck in Belgium. Hondas from that era are notorious for reg/rec issues and there are countless internet posts about them, mine was no different – however after some research and going through the points below I was able to identify and replace the problem parts and fit in a voltmeter for early warning.

## The main things that can cause unwanted battery drain are:

* Cheap alarm systems (or badly fitted ones)
* Leaving parking lights on
* Leaving heated grips on
* 12v Sockets if not fitted correctly
* Accessories left plugged into 12v sockets, sat nav’s, phone chargers etc
* Bad wiring or connectors
* Dead battery
* Charging system problems

Assuming the top and easy to check items are fine it’s time to move on and check on the battery and charging systems components, so get your voltmeter out.

## Checking the battery voltage

Charge up the battery fully and start the bike. Check the voltage across the terminals at idle and at high revs. At idle it should be around 12 volts, but when revved up to around 4-5k rpm, depending on bike, the voltage should read 14 – 14.4v. If it reads less, around 13v, or more, 15v+, there is an issue with the charging system that will need to be fixed. Likewise if it doesn’t rise at all from the 12v when the bike is off.

Riding without the battery being charged by the bike is like using the electrical power as a kind of fuel – once its gone the bike will stop, and will not start, bump start, or stay running once jumped. You can travel quite a distance on just battery power, especially if you have your lights off. I made back from Belgium.. (just).

### Over Volting – 15v +

This is the worst outcome of the battery voltage check as this means the reg/rec is faulty and is pushing too much power through the system. This can damage the rest of the electrical components and even start a fire. You’ll often see melted connectors as symptom and the R/R will be extremely hot to touch.

The fix is to replace the R/R with a new one. Check out upgraded ones and see which other bikes ones may fit (see section below for more reg/rec info), and avoid cheap knock offs – they will only fail. The cheap one I bought as a back up for my Belgium trip lasted 15 minutes before dying.

### Under Volting – ~13v

Second scenario, although not having as dramatic potential outcomes is much the same fix. Although in this instance I would be tempted to try a new battery first if it is particularly old as this may remedy the issue. Otherwise check the reg/rec and stator to find the weak point and replace where necessary.

##### How can I prevent it happening again?

First thing I would do is check all the wiring for potential shorts/corrosion/bad connectors. Then you might want to consider installing a voltmeter somewhere so you can monitor the voltage at all times and get a warning if the battery is not charging. This is what I did on my old VFR750. I noticed a difference too once the charging system was rewired as I had several bad connections and bodged soldering jobs. Things like this are common on old bikes especially ones that have changed owners a lot!

Some say that a voltmeter is overkill and I understand their point, it can be distracting or paranoia inducing. Another option is to put in a little LED somewhere that changes colour at the right voltage. <13 would be red and >13 green. Either option will help you not get stuck by providing early warning. Cue roadside bodge repairs in Belgium..

## What makes up the charging system?


### The stator

This is your bikes version of a cars alternator. It basically works in the same way, but doesn’t require a charged battery to function and is much less weight. It consists of coiled wire wrapped around spokes. It sits on the side of the engine and is what generates electrical power. A outer fly wheel with magnets spins round the coils creating electricity.

When the stator fails it no longer sends power round the bike, causing it to us up battery power to keep running. It’s generally straight forward to fit and is relatively inexpensive.

### Regulator/Rectifiers

The stator sends AC current up to the rectifier, which converts it to DC and sends it to charge the battery or power your bike. The regulators job is keep the DC at the correct voltage to charge the 12v battery, usually around 13.8-14.4 volts. If the regulator part fails we get overvolting (see above). These two parts are packaged together in one little unit and when either fails, we can end up stuck on the side of the road with no power.

There are 2 types of re/rec used in motorcycles. SHUNT, and the better MOSFET types. Shunt versions are less efficient and generate more heat, while Mosfet reg/recs control the current flow better and run cooler. Think of it like a door. The shunt r/r closes and opens its door slowly, relying on the current for help. This creates a lot of excess heat. The Mosfet has an actual switch allowing it to open and close much quicker, generating a lot less heat.

In a system where there is a lot of heat generated the shunt versions are more likely to melt the connectors, causing any number of the problems listed above. If overheating is your issue, and even if it’s not, I’d recommend a Mosfet regulator rectifier.

### How do I know if this reg/rec is Mosfet?

Most OEM ones are made by one company, Shindengen. They supply the major manufacturers and each unit has a code. Mosfet ones start with “FH” while the shunt versions “SH”. Check any replacement your considering has a code starting FH.

### I got my new Mosfet R/R fitted! All ok?

Great, however it is recommended to fit a new battery at the same time. Due to the way the Mosfet reg/rec works and how it sends voltage it might not be happy with an older battery. I’d suggest using your sense on this and if it’s an old battery, replace it.

Also, it’s worth noting that all reg/rec’s design for bikes work in the same way, so even if the connectors are different you could still use it on your bike, by fitting a new connector or wiring with pins directly. It does make life easier when fitting an uprated one if it physically fits in place on your bike and if its tried and tested. A Google search as to which ones work best with your bike will get some quick answers.


## How do I know if my reg/rec is dead?

There are tests you can do on it with a voltmeter to check to see if it is functional or not. Useful knowledge to have and also to check if a second-hand unit is good/yours is dead before pulling apart your bike. This video here from Electrex world shows you how, using the diode tester on a multimeter:
