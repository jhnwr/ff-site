      <description>I am an avid camper and rider but only recently began mixing the two. Camping for me is historically been large tents and lots of gear – cooking equipment, entertainment; everything I thought I could ever possibly need would get chucked into the back of the estate car and off we went.
However that’s not really viable when you’re on two wheels. Space is a premium so gear must be slimmed down and match the required criteria.</description>
