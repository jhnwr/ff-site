      <description>And why tail packs are my go to..
lot of people&amp;rsquo;s first point of call for touring or long trips away would be a big, upright touring bike with hard panniers and a large top box. With lots of space for stowing away items that you may (or may not) need whilst your away. This is a fair point, but unless you are doing serious miles and several weeks away is this really necessary?</description>
