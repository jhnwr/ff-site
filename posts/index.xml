      <description>Kriega US-30 Drypack Review I’ve been thinking a lot about sorting out some more trips for this year. I didn’t manage to get out and about as much as I’d have liked to last year, so I want to get something organised soon. I’d really like to do a solo camping trip and I’ve started thinking about what I’d need to take. This got me thinking about how much stuff I can fit in my US30.</description>

      <title>Motorbike Camping – Best Tent?</title>

      <description>I am an avid camper and rider but only recently began mixing the two. Camping for me is historically been large tents and lots of gear – cooking equipment, entertainment; everything I thought I could ever possibly need would get chucked into the back of the estate car and off we went.
However that’s not really viable when you’re on two wheels. Space is a premium so gear must be slimmed down and match the required criteria.</description>

      <title>The Quest for Power: Is more BHP always better?</title>

      <description>It’s an interesting paradigm when talking about power figures, and what they actually mean to the vast majority of us. The fact that power is a comparable measure of a bikes performance leads to lots of debate and potentially discarding bikes as they have slightly less power than the competitor. If we take the earliest Fireblades, which had around 111 hp, and compare to now the 2019 model is pushing 171hp – this begs the question, have we gone too far?</description>

      <title>Motorbike Ground Anchors – Reviews, Fitting and Using</title>

      <description>Since I moved to a new house with a garage, I started looking at sorting out security for my ZX6R. Previously it lived outside under a cover, tucked away in a private gated car park, but now even though it’s behind a garage door I think it’s always worth doing everything you can to deter potential thieves. That’s where a good ground anchor can help.
It’s a relatively inexpensive way to add another level of security making it all that bit harder for someone to take your pride and joy.</description>

      <title>Why Does My Motorcycle Battery Keep Draining?</title>

      <description>Today I’m going to go through a few points and tips as to help explain what might be causing your battery to go flat and how to prolong the life of your battery and bike electrical system. I have first hand experience having previously owned a mid-90s Honda VFR750 which had charging problems, even causing me to (almost) get stuck in Belgium. Hondas from that era are notorious for reg/rec issues and there are countless internet posts about them, mine was no different – however after some research and going through the points below I was able to identify and replace the problem parts and fit in a voltmeter for early warning.</description>

      <title>Setting Your Throttle Free Play</title>
      <link>/2018/05/setting-throttle-free-play/</link>

      <description>It’s important to get the throttle free play correct as it will improve responsiveness and the ability to ride smoothly. The throttle is one of the most important controls your bike has so it’s got to be precise to enable you to ride properly. Generally manufacturers recommend around 2-3mm of travel before the cable pulls. This means that when you fully close the throttle expect it to have this amount of free play before it engages – too much and you wont be able to ride smoothly.</description>

      <description>And why tail packs are my go to..
lot of people&amp;rsquo;s first point of call for touring or long trips away would be a big, upright touring bike with hard panniers and a large top box. With lots of space for stowing away items that you may (or may not) need whilst your away. This is a fair point, but unless you are doing serious miles and several weeks away is this really necessary?</description>
