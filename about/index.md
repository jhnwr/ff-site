# About FullyFaired.com


# Hi everyone! 

I'm JR and I am the guy behind fullyfaired.com. I've been riding for over 10 years now and have found my home on sportbikes. I currently ride a ZX6R J1, which is the perfect mix of comfort and sport for my daily needs. On this site I have lots of information regarding ownership, tips, tricks and things that will hopefully answer your basic questions about riding a sportbike for daily use, and trips away. I have traveled parts of Europe and done several overnighters or weekends away riding and am always happy to share my knowledge for new comers and people planning their first trips.

I was a bit late to bikes really - my love for cars was most prominent growing up, loved the mid 90s Japanese turbo cars and eventually owned a Celica GT4 which was fantastic. But by my early twenties I'd started to take much more of an interest in 2 wheels, mostly stemming from watching some cracking MotoGP races. At the time it was much more interesting than F1, seemed more dangerous and had some serious rivalries going on. What was even better was the potential for lots of different winners and crazy overtakes, and not just a parade around a circuit with no overtaking. It really got me wanting to get my license and start riding. I managed to get to Donnington to watch one year whjen James Toseland finished 5th if I recall, behind Rossi who had fallen off once and in the pouring rain. The 250s and 125s as they were then were great to watch too. At the end the crowd rushed the track and JT barely made it back - missing boots gloves etc. If they could I'm sure they'd have had most of the bike away!

### Bike History:

Aprilia RS125 full powerÂ  - (just don't do it)

Honda XR125 - which I passed my test on

Susuki GS500 - dull as but served a purpose

Honda VFR750 - loads of issues but great bike

Kawasaki ZX6R J1 - a perfect mix for me right now

Bike Future:

Who knows?! I'm enjoying the ZX6R right now so will hold onto that for another year or so. Going forward though I'd love to own, in no particular order:

Fireblade 954

KTM Duke 690

Triumph Street Triple
